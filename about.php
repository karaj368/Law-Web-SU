            <div class="space16"></div>
            <p>School of Law and Constitutional Studies seeks to prepare students for the practice of law in India. We must attempt to instill in
              every student a respect for the rule of law, a devotion to the ideal of public service, and a commitment to basic professional values:
              honesty, diligence, competence, intelligence, and civility. To achieve this the school seeks to promote multi-disciplinary analysis of
              the socio-legal problems by designing its course-structure and teaching methods to realize these objectives.</p>
